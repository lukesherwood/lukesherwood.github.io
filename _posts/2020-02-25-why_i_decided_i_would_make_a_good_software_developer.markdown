I've only had a few revelations in my life where I came to realise that this thing I'd been mulling over for years finally culminated into one clear option that I just had to take. The first was to go to university to study Earth Sciences. The second was to marry my wife. And most recently, to change careers to become a Software Developer.

It's funny to me how when those revelations hit it all becomes so clear and you find yourself wondering why you hadn’t thought of it sooner. I can't actually answer that question, but I can answer why I think coding is for me.

# Learning
I'm constantly looking for new things to learn both professionally and personally. I have been dissatisfied that my current job doesn't provide enough opportunities to learn, so I’ve taken matters into my own hands and typically listen to masses of Non-Fiction audiobooks whilst doing mind-numbing tasks at work. This is where one of the many appeals of coding comes in - I expect that I could be learning forever with all the new languages and technologies and ways of working being popularised, as well as continuing to gain further aptitude in my favourite languages - Ruby and Python.

# Laziness
I've spent a lot of time sugarcoating this trait of mine in resumes and in other jobs with phrases such as "I like to put a lot of effort into making things more efficient and simplifying procedures, which helps turn-around times." But in reality, I do this because I'm straight-up lazy. Why do things the way things have always been done when you can find a new sneaky way to get it done faster and with less effort? Rather than needing to beat around the bush with euphemisms, this trait is actively encouraged and valued in coding. Every time I hear Avi or the other instructors saying proudly that they're lazy, I smile. As a friend of mine recently said: "I've found my people!"

# Problem-solving
In every job I’ve had, I've found the most rewarding part was to fix something after it has gone wrong. It took me a long time to realise that not everyone is like this. But I felt using some creativity and intense focus to solve a problem was the most rewarding way to spend time - particularly if you are successful in finding a solution *see: "Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi*. It's clear to me now how integral these skills are to coding as most of the time things are broken, and as soon as you've fixed it you get another problem to solve. I'm gonna be spending a lot of time in a Flow state!

There you have it, my reasons for changing careers and finding my calling - finally.
