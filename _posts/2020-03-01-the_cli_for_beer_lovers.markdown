Imagine for a second that you didn't have a fast enough phone to run Google Maps, or enough time to search through yelp reviews but you are desperately thirsty to try out a new brewery.

The beer lovers CLI is just what you need.

Select your city from a list of cities and just like that you can receive information about all the good breweries in your city. Selecting a brewery will then shoot you off to their website for more information or just head directly to the address provided.

My first project was one that was close to my heart and I was happy with how it turned out. When I started the project I was relatively comfortable with setting up good object orientated code but totally uncomfortable with scraping. Which led me to the most difficult part of the project - identifying a good scrapable website. The one which I eventually chose had easily selectable elements with Nokogiri and everything seemed to work intuitively. I was happy with that, and after watching many of the provided videos about setting up a project while using the Learn IDE I began coding.

Pretty quickly I had some working code and was thinking to myself: 'this is great!'

Then I realised the website I chose wasn't that great after all. I was scraping from a search page on TripSavvy.com and it was showing a lot of results for things that weren't breweries. I was really annoyed and was thinking about restarting the whole thing. But I couldn't quite do it to myself and managed to write some ugly code to get around it.

Later down the track I managed to move it around a bit and pretty up the code, so while not exactly ideal to scrape from the first two pages of a search it was valuable in that it taught me some aspects of coding I may not have learnt otherwise.

Without further ado, please check out my Beer Lovers CLI [](https://github.com/lukesherwood/project_beer.git)

Cheers
