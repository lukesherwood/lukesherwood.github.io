My second Flatiron course project!

We're locked down in the middle of a pandemic and it's a crazy time but I'm super happy to have finished this project. It's really shown me how far I've come. I knocked out the skeleton of this app within minutes thanks to [Corneal ](https://github.com/thebrianemory/corneal) and a few hour later I had a working app.

Then the part that I really enjoyed was getting deep down rabbit holes by following "hey, I wonder if I can add this feature?". 

### IDEA -->> RESEARCH -->> IMPLEMENT -->> FIX BROKEN APP 
###   And Repeat


## The Important Lessons

*  Having recently moved to a local environment I found myself forgetting about best practices for committing and  pushing code to github. I realised this was because I wasn't worried about the Learn IDE crashing and losing my work as happened numerous times in the last project. But by the end of it I feel like I had got into a good habit of working in stages to fix one piece at a time, which made the commits easier.

*  Creating simple code that works isn't always the best. It means you get attached to its simplicity and you find yourself bending over backwards trying to implement a little more functionality. When if you had of thought it out a bit more at the beginning it'd make it easier down the track. This happened in ths project where I had originally only created two classes, a User having_many Recipes. It worked well enough but was making it super hard to output ingredients of the recipe. So after talking with an instructor I added an Ingredients class and the app was the better for it.
