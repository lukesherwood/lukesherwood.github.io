Long before my career change from engineering geology to software development I had an idea for an app. The gap that I saw in the market was that there was no easy-to-access directory for hiking tracks in New Zealand. I wanted something like a Yelp for hiking trails where you could find tracks around where you were and other folks would have kindly rated the best ones so you could make the most of a day or afternoon. Here in NZ we have a government department that has a website and an API for all the hikes in NZ, it’s a behemoth of data. So, I thought, it’d be easy to use that data to make an app with all the hikes and then slowly go about rating the good ones that me and my friends hiked. But this was well before I knew anything about software engineering or web development so I was stuck in the starting blocks. I continued to go about my life in a career I was no longer passionate about and my app idea got pushed further and further down my To-Do list.

I finally had an epiphany and decided to go after a career in software development by starting a software engineering bootcamp with Flatiron. While I progressed though the course – learning Ruby, CSS, HTML, Ruby on Rails and finally Javascript and React JS I thought to myself I really should be able to create this app that I had been thinking about for years. When it came time for my final project, I decided that now is as good a time as any. The Idea was a lot more complicated than any of the other projects I had completed in the course but I really wanted to stretch myself and see what I was now capable of.

It was harder than I thought. It took a lot longer than I thought it would as well. I had to make a lot of compromises to get a working app out the door but I’ve got something to work with now, a minimum viable product, as they say. Upon reflection, it made a lot of sense as to why I struggled to make a fully functioning Yelp for hiking trails - there are usually full teams working for weeks on functionality I thought I could create in a day, for example favoriting hikes, reviews, etc. 

I’m proud of what I have created and I am looking forward to all the rest of the lessons I will learn as I build out the rest of the functionality of the app I called Hikable. Unfortunately, the other lesson I painfully learnt was that if you sit around on an idea too long someone will come along before you and do it first. And that is exactly what happened here with AllTrails coming to NZ and doing basically the same thing. Now that I have the expertise, though, I’ll be able to jump on my next idea a lot quicker.
