I think everyone has a love hate relationship with Javascript. But what do you do when you realize you've just switched from one to the other? 
  
Learning Javascript is tough, especially having come from a strong rooting in ruby. Ruby is just so nice, with all its neat and pretty almost punctuation-less code. Then comes JS a with all its functions and semicolons, one character out of place and you'll spend an hour figuring out what you've done wrong. 
  
But I think I made a breakthrough in this penultimate project. Javascript is all about behavior and doing stuff. And funnily enough it takes actually doing it to really learn it. I certainly struggled getting the hang of JS throughout the course, I had grown used to being able to just write out code that worked first time and looked sucscinct and pretty with ruby. So, I really was blocking myself from writing in JS because it was hard, took a long time to actually do the writing and then it often failed to even work. Frustrated, I often skipped the stretch goals for each lesson.  
  
When I came to the project, however, I had bundles of time to work through each little function - getting it working, breaking it to get something else working, then re-fixing everything. It was tiring work, and it took me so damn long to even write out a functioning button at the beginning.  
  
By the end of the project however I was getting the feeling for all the little workers - the functions - how they were working together - interacting with each other - sometimes sitting waiting until the other had finished its work - then coming together within a class to fulfill a certain mission. The classes would then interact with each other in the symphony that is the application. Quite beautiful. 
  
Am I now a Javascript lover? Where do people like me hide when every other coder is bagging on JS syntax? Let's see what happens in this final section before I go there.
